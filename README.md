[Bootstrap3 Dialog](https://github.com/nakupanda/bootstrap3-dialog) give another level to create Bootstrap modal become flexible. It's write on javascript, and I don't know much about it. So I made
some wrapper to call this modal with Yii2 framework. IMHO, rather than create .php file and create javascript on it, you can do a lot of trick with Yii2 feature to create Bootstrap's Modal more efficient.
