It's write on javascript, and I don't know much about it. So I made\r\nsome wrapper to call this modal with Yii2 framework. IMHO, rather than create .php file and create javascript on it, you can do a lot of trick with Yii2 feature to create Bootstrap's Modal more efficient. \r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).\r\n\r\nEither run\r\n\r\n```\r\nphp composer.phar require \"mdscomp/yii2-bootstrap-dialog\" \"dev-master\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nor add\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"mdscomp/yii2-bootstrap-dialog\": \"dev-master\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nto the require section of your `composer.json` file.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n---------\r\n\r\n[Usage Wiki](http://mzdani.github.io/yii2-bootstrap-dialog/usage.html)\r\n\r\nOther Text\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nI'm so sorry for this `unpretty` code.
